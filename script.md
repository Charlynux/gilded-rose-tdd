Hello, it's Duncan

What you see with these videos is usually the second or third take. If I try something, and it turns out to be blatantly silly, I don't inflict that on you. But mostly I try to show sessions as they happened, just a bit smoother because I practiced. I then edit out fat-fingered keystrokes and audio stumbles in order to get the thing finished before you loose interest.

I try to balance pace and honesty. My assumption is that you don't want to sit through the tedium of real-time programming (at least in my real-time), but you don't want to miss anything significant either. This may give the impression that I'm a better touch-typist or refactorer than I am, but I haven't planned the whole app - I have to live with the design decisions that I made in previous installments.

This episode is a bit different, because I only wrote one line of production code, and then tried to break it, which is pretty tedious. So it's far more, [Here's one I prepared earlier](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0857835130)
